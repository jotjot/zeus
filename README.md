Buddha
===============

Buddha is an RTMP Server that receives a streaming video from a Flash client and writes the video into an FLV file.

(And, oh yeah, I've named this server __Buddha__.)


How to use it
---------------

Build it with:

```
./configure && make && make test
```

And run with:

```
./bin/buddha
```

The server will be run on ```rtmp://localhost:1935```
